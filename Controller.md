ApplicationController class that inherits from the Sinatra::Base class.

set :default_content_type, 'application/json' sets the default content type to application/json, which means that all responses from the controller will be in JSON format.

There are several route definitions in the controller that handle HTTP requests and responses for the application. Here's a brief explanation of each route:

get "/" - This route returns a JSON message when the root URL is requested.

get "/todos" - This route returns a JSON list of all todos in the database. If no todos are found, it returns a 404 error.

get "/todos/:id" - This route returns a JSON representation of a single todo item based on its ID.

post "/todos" - This route creates a new todo item in the database based on the parameters sent in the request body. If the item is saved successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the new item. If not, it returns a 422 error with a JSON representation of the validation errors.

patch "/todos/:id" - This route updates an existing todo item in the database based on its ID and the parameters sent in the request body. If the item is updated successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the updated item. If not, it returns a 422 error with a JSON representation of the validation errors.

delete "/todos/:id" - This route deletes an existing todo item from the database based on its ID. If the item is deleted successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the deleted item. If not, it returns a 500 error.

get "/categories" - This route returns a JSON list of all categories in the database. If no categories are found, it returns a 404 error.

get "/categories/:id" - This route returns a JSON representation of a single category based on its ID.

post "/categories" - This route creates a new category in the database based on the parameters sent in the request body. If the category is saved successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the new category. If not, it returns a 422 error with a JSON representation of the validation errors.

patch "/categories/:id" - This route updates an existing category in the database based on its ID and the parameters sent in the request body. If the category is updated successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the updated category. If not, it returns a 422 error with a JSON representation of the validation errors.

delete "/categories/:id" - This route deletes an existing category from the database based on its ID. If the category is deleted successfully, it returns a JSON representation of the deleted category. If not, it returns a 500 error.

delete "/todos/category/:category_id" - This route deletes all todos that belong to a given category based on the category ID. It then returns a JSON message indicating that the todos have been refreshed.
